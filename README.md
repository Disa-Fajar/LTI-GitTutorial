Users can enter a website URL and click a button to open it in the default browser. Additionally, this application provides direct access to other applications installed on the computer, such as File Explorer, Microsoft Word, Canva, and Arduino IDE. This program is especially useful for users who frequently switch between different applications and websites without having to open each application individually.]
