### Picture Color Customization
This program, developed using PyQt6, is designed for picture color customization, featuring an intuitive interface with essential tools for basic image adjustments. It includes two buttons: one for selecting an image from the local system and another for choosing a color to apply as an overlay or modification. The selected image is displayed in a central area, allowing users to view changes in real time. Additionally, the program provides two sliders, one for adjusting the image's brightness and the other for modifying its contrast, giving users precise control over the image's appearance. This application is a simple yet powerful solution for users seeking to enhance or customize images effortlessly.
